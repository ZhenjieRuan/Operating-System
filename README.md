# Operating-System
Class Code for BU CS552

You guys wonder where all the code is? I've removed it all from github. 

Here is a message to all the **THIEVES** who steal my code to use in class. Learning CS, especially learning fundamentals of operating system is no easy task, and you should put good effort into it and figure things out by yourselves. I've spent countless nights staying up late to finish the assignments, and so should you guys. Yes, the assignments are hard, and they should be, otherwise you won't benefit from it. Plus, the assignments are so interesting and well designed, you can tell the professor really spent a good amount of time making it, please pay respect to the efforts of others. You guys think cheating on assignments and exams is okay? As long as you don't get caught? No, what you are doing is wasting your money and more seriously, wasting your once a life time chance to experience the happiness of attending a college and actually learning something. You are cheating on your life. So **STOP CHEATING!**
